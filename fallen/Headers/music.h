  Looks like we need a few more features to the sound system for Music

 Overall Music Volume, Overall Sfx Volume   (music being most important at the moment its drowning out all sfx)

Need to be able to fade out a piece, (i.e fade out current and queue another to start when music has reached 0 volume )

Loop Music, so no queued music will play unless the current music is faded out

Stop Music (a variation on fade out I suppose)


Fade in a piece of music, queued piece fades in.

Enquirey function  which sample is playing on the music channel,



+ More currently unknown functions
